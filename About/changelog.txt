Updated to v1.3b

Changelog:	
	
	-Moved some things around in order to make the Vegetable Garden Patch a little easier to make.
	-Doubled smokeleaf trimming recipes ( ie: 2 smokeleaves = 1 bud, seed and fiber, etc).

	-Fixed some spelling mistakes. (thanks Orion TH)

	-All Edibles should have about a 3-4 day tolerance stage 	loss time and 15 days of addiction.
	(Let me know if there are still problems with this, but it 	has been pretty consistent in my tests.)

	-Lots of recipe adjustments.  Mostly small tweaks to try and 	prevent late game stockpile issues.
