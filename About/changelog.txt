Updated to v1.10b

Smokeleaf Industry
Changelog:

	-Fixed Chemfuel recipe producing Hempoline. (thanks Vlad0mi3r)
	-Reduced Hemp solar panel cost. *A note about the solar panels.  They still store the same 1700w as the vanilla panels, but they transmit 10x more power when they are active.  I didn't have time to make a new class to raise the storage capacity, but will look to do so in the future.*
	-Reduced market value of Hempoline.
